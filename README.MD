# Palindrome Test

### I recently tackled a Palindrome Test during a hands-on coding challenge in an interview.

*  This is the solution I devised during the interview. Please feel free to refine it further, considering I had only 10 minutes to complete it.
*  I employed Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology throughout the Palindrome Test during my interview.
